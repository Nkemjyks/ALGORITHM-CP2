# ALGORITHM-CP2

This program performs insertion sorting of array of numbers in ascending order.
A recap of the algorithm is as follows:
1. Declaration of variables, key and count as length of array submitted
2. Two loops with one inside the other
3. The outer loops through the array and pick up each array item for checking
4. The inner loop compares the selected item with each of the sorted part of the array and fixes it where it fits 
5. By the end of the loops, all the items must have been sorted, and the array is returned back.
